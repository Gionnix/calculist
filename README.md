## About this repo

For private beta participants, please use this repository's [issues](https://github.com/calculist/calculist/issues) to report bugs or make feature requests. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can email me at [dan@calculist.io](mailto:dan@calculist.io).

The code in this repo is work in progress. The current working code can be found [here](https://github.com/calculist/app.calculist.io). Eventually, this repo will contain all the code that drives the list document model and list editing interface. The idea is that Calculist will eventually be both a standalone app and a node package that other developers can use within their own apps and APIs.
