## About this repo

The code in this repo is in a state of transition as the core document functionality is being decoupled from [the current working code](https://github.com/calculist/app.calculist.io) that drives app.calculist.io.

Eventually, this repo will contain all the code that drives the list document model and editing interface, and it will be generic enough to be reusable in many different contexts.
